* Tasks(20:01 22 Jan 2016)
** Duration:
*** (4 - 6 Hours).
** [#A] Write down what you need to do:
*** TODO Write a paragraph about how you went about solving the problem.
I started by setting my platform in shape. I created a folder named Systemic Logic Capture Form,
in it containing all the libraries, html files, css fils, javascript files, and
text files related to this task.

Firstly I created my index.html file which contained all the imports
to my css and javascript files. This file also contains angular directories
which defines the module that will be used for the project.

- <html ng-app="ideaCapture">
- <div ng-view></div>

The ng-view angular directory defines to the angular module which
part of the html it will display content.
From this point on, it was a matter of creating the angular module indstance in app.js,
create a means for the app to navigate between templates, create the angular
view controllers in controller.js, and create the angular js services in facroty.js.
I decided to use angular js as a javascript library because it is cutting edge and
is basically compatible with many libraries which are proving to be worthy, Libraries
such as knockoutjs, firebase, foundation and mysql through php.



*** TODO Write down any challenges you faced.
Creating the select dropdown that would house the category names, I realized that
the value for each option was not specified.

I don't know how to save images.

*** TODO Write down how you solved those challenge.
I went with passing integer as the
value. An integer value will act as a category ID in a database structue.
- tblCategory
-- CategoryID (INT)
-- Category Title (VARCHAR)
